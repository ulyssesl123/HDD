Historical Data Download
HDD stands for Historical_Data_Download. I was inspired after the frustration with Yahoo Finance not allowing me to download historical data for the S&P500 index (^GSPC). I allowed for the user to enter 3 stock tickers (ALL CAPS) as well as the benchmark S&P500. Hope this helps with your future analysis. #CAPM FARMAFRENCH #PORTFOLIOOPTIMIZATION
